Sea Defender

Simple missile command clone in 96k for linux/win/macosx

No music, sorry - plenty of space but no talent.

Requires videocard with GLSL support, tested on GeForce FX5200, Radeon X1300 and Apple's software renderer.

Using GLFW and math3d++, font is from http://apostrophiclab.pedroreina.net/.



The code is horrible due to looming deadline for compo entry submission (which i missed anyway in the end),
so i apologize in advance to anyone reading it.

Data for this game are sourced from .svg path elements (curves), which are converted by ruby scripts
in utils/ directory to .m and .mfont binary files, which in turn are then processed into .h source code
files as resource inserts (because there is no cross-platform resource handling in C++).
